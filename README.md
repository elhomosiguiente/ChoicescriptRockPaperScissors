# choicescript-rock-paper-scissors
A repository for a project I did years ago using the ChoiceScript programming language.
This project emulates the classic Rock,Paper,Scissors game. The game ends when you have 3 wins, 3 losses, or 3 ties.
Your opponent isn't dynamic, it's only an AI using randomness to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
