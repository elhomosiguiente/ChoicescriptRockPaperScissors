Welcome to your very first ChoiceScript game!
Using the innovative Choicescript computer language,this is also the first video game I ever made!
.............................
Okay,maybe not a video game,but this is more like a Choose Your Own Adventure book.

Just on a computer.

Anyhow,yeah,this game is called Rock,Paper,Scissors,in which you...well you know what to do.I mean,who hasn't played this awesome game?

To see how many wins,losses,and tie you have,just click the Show Stats button.The game ends when you get 3 wins,losses,or ties,so watch out!

And good luck!
